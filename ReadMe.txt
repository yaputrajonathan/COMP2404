purpose     : to have multiple rooms of different types, including a suite, some
              premium rooms, and regular rooms. The hotel will also keep track of the multiple guests that stay at the hotel.
              The reservations will be managed by a separate control-like object, that serves as the reservation manager.
              When a new reservation is requested, the reservation manager will be responsible for determining which room
              of the requested type is available for the duration of the guestâ€™s stay.
